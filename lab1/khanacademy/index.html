    <h1>Whispers of the Unseen</h1>
    <p>In the stillness,<br> where shadows dance,<br>
Quiet secrets find their chance—<br>
A whispered breeze,<br> a fleeting sigh,<br>
A language that we can't deny.<br>
The moonlight hums a gentle tune<br>
Beneath the vast and silent moon,<br>
Its glow, a pulse, a tender beam,<br>
Unveiling all we cannot deem.<br>
What’s felt, but never quite displayed,<br>
Lives in the spaces where light fades.<br>
A truth that only hearts can know,<br>
A current hidden, soft as snow.</p>
